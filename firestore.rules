/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset allows public read access to GDP records, with unrestricted create, update, and delete operations. Since the application manages GDP records globally without user-specific ownership, no authorization checks are performed.
 * @data_structure Data is stored in a top-level collection called `gdp_records`. Each document represents a single GDP record.
 * @key_security_decisions No specific access controls are defined, so all operations are allowed.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization Not applicable, as no authorization is performed.
 * @structural_segregation Not applicable, as there's no separation between public and private data.
